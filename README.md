Thank you for responding. I really want to release the website but there are a couple of outstanding items. Mainly, a list of bugs and I need to do some content updates. I sent a list of change requests as per below:

 

For the site at: https://igoodwork.vercel.app/

 

I created some new templates on Figma to reflect desired changes. Could you assist updating the pages accordingly?

 

Here is the confirmation page for Email user creation:

also, please note that captcha function is not working on the vercel website

 

Here is success message for retrieving password:

note: currently there is a bug, it currently logs you in automatically after you try to retrieve your password even though user has not reset anything. Can we have it go to confirmation message instead and keep user logged out?

 

Here is success message for Contact Us form:

Removed button for the submitting a Question:
