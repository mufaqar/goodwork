Issues


it's better but still not behaving exactly as i would like. please see first pic. it looks ok. 
but if i increase the width, the image resizes and large portions of it gets cut off. (see 2nd image)


Second issue. it looks like the image height for the product pages is too large:

according to figma file, image height on those pages should be approx. 450px
